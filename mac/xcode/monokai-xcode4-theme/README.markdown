# Monokai Xcode 4 Theme

I've been using a Monokai theme in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) for a while and I really like it.  It's easy on my eyes.

This Xcode 4 theme is ported from [Joseph McLaughlin's theme for Xcode 3](https://github.com/mclaughj/Monokai-Xcode-Theme).  All I did was convert it to the new Xcode 4 format.  Joseph's theme was a port of the [Textmate Monokai theme](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme).

To install, copy the file to **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes** and restart Xcode.
